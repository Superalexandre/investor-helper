The Monitor measures the value of spending and hence does not adjust for price changes. If prices are rising, sales volumes will increase by less than sales values. In times of price deflation, sales volumes will increase by more than sales values. Retailers report the value of their sales and sales in the equivalent week a year ago. These figures are reported both in total and on a ‘like-for-like’ basis. The percentage increase in the value of sales on a ‘like-for-like’ basis removes the effect of the expansion of retail floor space by the retailers concerned on their sales total. Due to the sample being biased towards large retailers, the ‘like-for-like’ increase usually provides a more accurate guide to general spending patterns, though it will be biased downwards as an estimate of the growth rate for retail as a whole.\nPeriod: Aug\nReference Date: 2024-08-31T00:00:00Z\n\nSource: BRC - British Retail Consortium\nSource URL: https://www.brc.org.uk/\n"

Economists see the FIPE index as an early gauge of Brazil's benchmark IPCA inflation index, which the central bank targets when setting interest rates. The Consumer Prices Index for the City of São Paulo is the most traditional indicator of the evolution of the cost of living of families in São Paulo city and one of the oldest indicators in Brazil. It was first calculated on January 1939 by the Statistics and Documentation Division of the São Paulo City Government. In 1968, the duty of calculating the index was transferred to the Institute of Economic Research linked to the Economics Department of USP and later on to Fipe, after its creation in 1973.\nPeriod: Aug\nReference Date: 2024-08-31T00:00:00Z\n\nSource: FIPE - Fundacao Instituto de Pesquisas Economicas\nSource URL: https://www.fipe.org.br/\n"

Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For each of the indicators measured (Business Activity, New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Inventory Change, Inventory Sentiment, Imports, Prices, Employment and Supplier Deliveries) this report shows the percentage reporting each response, and the diffusion index. An index reading above 50 percent indicates that the non-manufacturing economy in that index is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. Orders to the service producers make up about 90 percent of the US economy.\nPeriod: Aug\nReference Date: 2024-08-31T00:00:00Z\n\nSource: Institute for Supply Management\nSource URL: https://www.ismworld.org\n"
